  3M is considering acquiring Artemis Adhesives, a mid-sized specialty 
  adhesives manufacturer, for approximately $500M. This acquisition is 
  strategically important as it would fill critical gaps in 3M's supply chain, 
  reducing dependency on third-party suppliers and mitigating supply chain risk
